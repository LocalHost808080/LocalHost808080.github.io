## Project Introduction

### Title

Development of Library Management System with Separate Front-End and Back-End

### Objectives

In this project I aim to develop a library management system with separate front-end and back-end based on Vue.js and Spring Boot frameworks. Through user authentication and authorization, it can realize simple book searching, borrowing, and returning functions from the readers' perspective, as well as book searching and management, book borrowing and returning request processing, and other functions from the administrator's perspective.
